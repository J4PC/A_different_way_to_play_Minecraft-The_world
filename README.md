Welcome on the official world download for the "A different way to play Minecraft"-World. Here you can download the world and explore everything it has to offer for yourself.

To download the world just follow these steps 
1. Go under Code and press the Download Zip button
2. Extract the files from the zip archive
3. Put the folder that contains multiple files inside into your Minecraft saves folder (probably at C:\Users\[Your Desktop name]\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves)

This isn't the exact world we play on, seeing as this is a pruned version with remote and unimportent chunks removed to drastically lower the file size.

The world was created on the 1.20.1 but is currently updated to the newest version at this time (1.21.5).
Some things, like redstone contraptions will probably break in different versions.

Enjoy.
